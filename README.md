# Zero
This website is a 100% static small E-commerce build for a T-shirt/Hoodie business that includes a fully functional cart. This repo holds the source code to this website strictly for showcasing my skills in advanced Javascript and Web Development in general. The products are fake and you cannot buy anything from this store.

# Logic
Local storage was used to allocate products to the cart for purchasing along with an API featuring the options for payments.
